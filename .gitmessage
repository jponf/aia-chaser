# run `git config commit.template .gitmessage` to set this template as default
# [<tag>] (If applied, this commit will...) <subject> (Max 72 char)
# |<----   Preferably using up to 50 chars   --->|<------------------->|
# Example:
# [feat] Implement automated commit messages


# (Optional) Explain why this change is being made
# |<----   Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters   ---->|

# --- COMMIT END ---
# Tag can be
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    refactor (refactoring code)
#    style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    doc      (changes to documentation)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    version  (version bump/new release; no production code change)
#    deps     (app dependencies updates)
#    dbg      (Changes in debugging code/frameworks; no production code change)
#    hack     (Temporary fix to make things move forward; please avoid it)
#    WIP      (Work In Progress; for intermediate commits to keep patches reasonably sized)
#    defaults (changes default options)
#    configs  (changes in project configurations)
#
# Note: Multiple tags can be combined, e.g. [fix][deps] Fix issue X with new dependency version
# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullet points in body
